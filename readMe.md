# Approach

- Collect a dataset of email messages, including both legitimate and spoofed emails. You can use publicly available datasets or create your own by generating spoofed emails.

- Preprocess the dataset by extracting features from the email messages. Some of the important features that can be used for detecting spoofed emails are sender's email address, domain name, IP address, email header information, email body, etc.

- Create an AIML model that uses the extracted features to classify emails as either legitimate or spoofed. You can use any of the classification algorithms supported by AIML, such as decision trees, naive Bayes, etc.

- Train the model on the preprocessed dataset and test its accuracy on a validation set. You can use cross-validation to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data.

- Once the model is trained and validated, you can deploy it as a web service that accepts an email message and returns a binary label indicating whether the email is legitimate or spoofed.

- Finally, you can test the model's performance on new email messages to evaluate its effectiveness in detecting spoofed emails.

# 1. Collecting Dataset

- We used public datasets
- This time we used the dataset Enron Email Dataset to train our model
- This is a 1.4GB dataset with legit as well as spoofed emails
- The folder containing the dataset is named as "DataSet"

# 2. Preprocessing of Data

Steps for preprocdessing of data

- Data Cleaning: Remove any unnecessary or redundant data in the dataset. This includes removing duplicate emails, emails with incomplete or missing data, and irrelevant or outdated emails.

- Email Parsing: Extract relevant information from the emails, such as the sender's email address, domain name, IP address, email header information, email body, and other relevant features that could help in detecting email spoofing.

- Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features for detecting email spoofing. You can use various techniques for feature selection, such as correlation analysis, mutual information, or principal component analysis.

- Feature Encoding: Convert categorical data into numerical data that can be processed by the machine learning algorithm. One way to do this is to use one-hot encoding to convert categorical data into binary vectors.

- Data Balancing: Ensure that the dataset is balanced to prevent bias in the machine learning model. This can be done by oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using synthetic data generation techniques.

- Data Normalization: Normalize the numerical data to a common scale to prevent features with larger ranges from dominating the model training.

- Train-Test Split: Split the preprocessed dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.
